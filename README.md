# Auto-Economacs

There is a beautiful book keeping application for mac called [Economacs (or iOrdning in Swedish)](http://www.iordning.se/sv/hem.html). I've been using it for years and I've always liked its simplicity over more heavy-weight, traditional book keeping applications. Perfect for freelancers with a mac :)

However, Economacs have always been missing a feature called "Konteringsmallar" in Swedish... Maybe translate to something like "templates for assigning account codes" in English ?

Not having this feature is a complete deal-breaker for me. But I realised that it could be built using a simple AppleScript. If you're unsure what this is, have a look at the video below to see the automatic magic that is "Konteringsmallar".
